              Elli, happy birthday. This is your official reminder that you are
              deeply thoughful, impossible not to admire, and genuinely
              magnetic in a way that feels almost rude to the rest of us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your caring nature and zest for life are extraordinary. You are
              one of the few people who can be both soft and striking at the
              same time, and somehow make it look effortless, which is frankly
              an unfair advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope today feels like a reflection of that: thoughtful,
              indulgent, a little glamorous, and full of people who are very
              aware of how lucky they are to know you (and trying to act normal
              about it).
            </p>
            <p>
              Happy birthday, Elli.

                There is a real ease to the way you carry yourself, and people
                trust it immediately. It is calm, disarming, and a little lethal.

                Your style feels intentional, confident, and quietly unfair to
                everyone else in the room. Respectfully, it is a problem.

                The best kind of kindness is quiet and consistent, and yours
                somehow still leaves a mark. Very graceful. Very dangerous.

            <p>
              I hope this next year brings you the kind of happiness that is not
              rushed: real peace, good people, exciting opportunities, and the
              kind of moments that make you feel adored.
            </p>
            <p>
              You deserve a day that feels rich, sweet, and unforgettable,
              because that is what your presence feels like to other people.
              Happy birthday to the girl who makes "just one look" feel like a
              whole event.
