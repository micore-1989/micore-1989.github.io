              Elli, happy birthday. This is your official reminder that you are
              deeply thoughful, very easy to admire, and genuinely special in
              a way that feels rare.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your caring nature and zest for life is extraordinary. You're one of
              the few who can balance a religious devotion to purpose, while still 
              finding time for others to feel seen and cared for. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope today feels like a reflection of that: thoughtful, joyful,
              and full of people who are happy they get to know you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Happy birthday, Elli.

              Elli Steinbach, I hope your birthday feels beautiful from start to
              finish.

            <p>
              I hope this next year brings you the kind of happiness that is not
              rushed: real peace, good people, exciting opportunities, and a lot
              of moments that remind you how loved you are.
            </p>
            <p>
              You deserve a day that feels as good as your presence feels to
              other people.
